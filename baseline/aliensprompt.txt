Aliens start abducting humans across the galaxy. It's up to a man who's determined to see them on the other side.

"I know what you want to do," says the voice. It's not the voice of Ripley's husband, Newt, but of Peter Cushing as a tough, no-nonsense cop. "You want to pull your pants down, lie down and go to sleep."<|endoftext|>

Aliens start abducting humans. A man with a terrible alien looking voice is heard. He says "Help me," but it's just a hoax. He has been replaced by an alien. The rest of the men in the facility are told to make the women and children disappear. They can't disobey orders. One woman was given a child, only to be told to throw it in the air and let it "just come down," then go back to work. Another woman said she needed to make a phone call for her husband in Florida, but the phone was no longer functional. When she dialed it, a loud noise came from inside the phone box. It was her son calling his mother, and it was ringing through the phone

Aliens start abducting humans and, while most of us don't want to be taken, we do want to make sure that others know that we're willing to be abducted. If we try to hide and wait for someone to notice, we risk leaving behind our families and friends, and eventually we may not be able to get back to the planet.

To address the situation, we need to try to raise awareness of the issue and keep up with the latest reports and research in search of answers. If we want to prevent alien abductions, we need to be prepared, and we need to be alert when aliens land in our midst.

By learning how the abductions work, you'll be able to be aware of possible indicators

From Paper 1
It has been two weeks, and the last of my kind has gone. It is only a matter of time until there will be nothing left. I’m not
sure what the hell is going on... I can’t think. I can hear a distant scream. I think of a strange, alien sound. I try to speak, but
am interrupted by something, something that feels like a drum, I ca not tell. I mean I’m just a little bit older than an average
human. But I can, and I can feel the vibrations . I hear the sound of a ship approaching. The ground quakes at the force of
the impact, and a loud explosion shatters the silence.
